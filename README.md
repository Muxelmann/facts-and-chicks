# The (unofficial) Facts and Chicks MenuApp

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Muxelmann/facts-and-chicks.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Muxelmann/facts-and-chicks)

This menu app obtains a random image from the facts and chicks website and displays the fact (and chick) as a popover. Both source and image can be accessed quickly.

The main reason behind this app was to challenge me with writing Swift **3** code, as well as making a funny little app.
